# Guess That Score!

Guess That Score is a game that my friends and I play during college football season where we try to guess the current score of games throughout the day only knowing the time remaining in the game.  The game is purely about bragging rights, luck, and excitement of the possibility of an upset.  Usually one person moderates the game and the others guess.  This app automates the moderation and serves the score of a random game after a set interval.

Currently a work in progress.

Future improvements:
- User Login and performance tracking
